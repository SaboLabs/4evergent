 * Abstract signing interface.

 * The pipeline NEVER depends on a concrete key store. A Signer implementation
 * is responsible for producing a signed transaction given an unsigned one.
 *
 * SECURITY CONTRACT
 * 1. sign() accepts an already-constructed, already-simulated Transaction object.
 *    It does NOT accept raw XDR or arbitrary operation arrays from callers.
 * 2. Implementations MUST NOT expose private key material through any method
 *    on this interface, through return values, or through error messages.
 * 3. Implementations MUST NOT log private keys, seeds, or mnemonics.
 * 4. Concrete signer selection is made at composition-root time (server boot),
 *    NEVER based on user-supplied input at request time.
