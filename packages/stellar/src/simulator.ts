/**
 * Simulator — mandatory gate before signing.
 *
 * A transaction that is NOT simulated, or whose simulation FAILED, MUST NOT be
 * signed or submitted. There are no fake or cached simulation results: every
 * code path through `simulate()` performs real Horizon network calls
 * (`fetchBaseFee()` and `accounts().accountId().call()`).
 *
 * Classic (non-Soroban) Horizon has no dry-run endpoint, so simulation is a
 * set of real network preconditions that must hold for submission to succeed:
 *  - the transaction envelope XDR is well-formed (round-trip),
 *  - the source account exists,
 *  - the transaction sequence number is exactly the on-chain sequence + 1,
 *  - the source account's XLM balance covers amount + fee + minimum reserve,
 *  - the destination is a valid G... address (validated by TransactionBuilder),
 *  - the transaction fee is >= network base fee.
 *
 * Signature correctness is NOT checked here — it is checked by Horizon at
 * submission time. This is why a simulation pass is necessary but not
 * sufficient: the pipeline must never present a simulation success as a
 * submission success.
